# MSBuffer

This is a repository for sharing code of the ArcGIS toolbox Multi-Scale Buffer (MSBuffer). It is a free and open source package built as an ArcToolbox in a python script to perform multi-scale spatial analyses for Conservation Unit buffer zones delimitation and management.

MSBuffer was developed and is maintained by the Spatial Ecology and Conservation Lab (LEEC), at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.

The repository has 5 folders:

•	MSBuffer_v1_0_stable: here you can find the main MSBuffer stable script, as well as scripts for testing MSBuffer.
•	old_versions: old versions of the code (before package release).
•	DB_demo: maps and data for testing and tutorials.
