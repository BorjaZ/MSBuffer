# MSBuffer

This is a repository for sharing code of the ArcGIS toolbox Multi-Scale Buffer (MSBuffer). It is a free and open source package built as an ArcToolbox in a python script to perform multi-scale spatial analyses for Conservation Unit buffer zones delimitation and management.

LSCorridors was developed and is maintained by the [Spatial Ecology and Conservation Lab](http://leec.eco.br) (LEEC), at Universidade Estadual Paulista, Rio Claro, SP, Brazil.

The repository has 3 folders:

- [MSBuffer_v1_00_code](https://github.com/LEEClab/MSBuffer/tree/master/MSBuffer_v1_00_code): here you can find the main MSBuffer stable script, as well as the ArcGIS toolbox itself.
- [old_versions](https://github.com/LEEClab/MSBuffer/tree/master/old_version): old versions of the code (before package release).
- [Data_test](https://github.com/LEEClab/MSBuffer/tree/master/Data_test): maps and data for testing and tutorials.
